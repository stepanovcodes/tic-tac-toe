# tic-tac-toe

What is special about my Tic-Tac-Toe version?

To make the game more exciting and enhance the overall experience, I have incorporated 8 different messages for a Tie situation and 8 different messages for a Win situation. These messages add an extra layer of excitement and make the outcome even more satisfying.
Google Font 'Roboto' is used.
Hover events now highlight available game elements by changing the border color to the color of the next player's turn.
